# Baguette's Personal Website

This is the source code for my website which I'll probably host various different personal projects on and random stuff. The only real reason that this is public is because I wanted to use github pages lmao but if you see this somehow and you want to use some of the code by all means go ahead even if i haven't put it under any license.
